# ThunderHades

ThunderHades is an API which is designed to bypass download limits from websites
with the use of a proxy pool and partial requests.

This project is still in its early stage so its not usable yet 

Features which needs to be implemented:  
  Dynamic File parsing(created file and extension should match the downloaded file)
  Dynamic Proxy Pool  
  Dynamically open connections(check how many connections the server allows)  
  Proxy handling(set bad/banned status if proxy is not working)
